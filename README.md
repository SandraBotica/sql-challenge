# sql-challenge

In the <EmployeeSQL> folder:

1. challenge9questions.ipynb    
      This is the bonus activity, answering all 8 questions in a jupyter notebook.
2. QuickDBD-Challenge9.svg   
      This is the quickdatabase diagram image saved. 
      You will notice that I wasn't able to include 'Not Null' as this app does it by default. 
      When this was exported to a PostgreSQL query it included Not Null.
3. Challenge9.sql         
      This is my sql file, which includes the table schemata and queries in one. 
      I kept changing my ERD, hence there are 2 other sql files, but please ignore these.
      
      For question 1 I demonstrated 2 ways to get the same result. I used joind and another used sub-query.
